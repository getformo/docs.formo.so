<Note>
Data is the lifeblood of any business. It helps you understand your customers, make impactful data-driven decisions, and drive growth. 

Without data, you're lost in a dark forest. Start measuring what matters.

## What is Formo?

[Formo](https://formo.so/about) is a data platform designed for onchain apps and protocols. Understand who your users are, where they come from, 
and how they engage with your app so you can build a better product. 

Here's an overview of what Formo can do:

## Product Analytics

[**Product analytics**](/features/product-analytics/overview) is actionable analytics designed for onchain apps:

- 📊 **Track web3 growth metrics.** Track visitor counts, DAU, WAU, MAU, transactions, retention, and churn. Measure engagement and growth over time.
- 🎯 **Onchain Attribution.** Identify the top channels and growth initiatives that drive onchain activity. Understand where users come from. 
- 🔒 **Privacy-friendly.** No third-party cookies, no personal data. Just clear, privacy-friendly insights limited to a single device, a single website, and a single day. Formo helps your dapp align with GDPR standards.

Get actionable insights into onchain user behaviour.

## Wallet Intelligence

[**Wallet intelligence**](/features/wallet-intelligence/overview) helps you understand and activate your high-value users:

-  🕵️‍♂️ **Wallet profiles.** Turn anonymous wallets into high-value users with unified onchain and offchain data. Track usage of specific, high-value wallets on your dapp. 
-  💯 **Wallet labels and reputation score.** Use wallet labels, onchain attestations, and proof-of-personhood to segment and rank your users.
-  💬 **Wallet messaging.** Activate high-value target users with deep personalization and insights.

## Token Gated Forms

[**Token Gated Forms**](/features/token-gated-forms/form-builder) helps you launch waitlists, forms, and surveys in web3.:

-  🔐 **Token gating.** Capture wallet data, token balances, attestations, and other onchain signals.
-  ✅ **Verified socials.** Verify Twitter accounts, Discord usernames, Farcaster, and more.
-  🎨 **Extensive template library.** Choose from a variety of form templates or build your own.

Focus on building amazing products and experiences. Spend less time building analytics, and more time building products with Formo.
