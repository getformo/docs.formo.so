Agentic analytics help lower the barrier of entry to understanding data. AI agents can act as autonomous teammates. They will generate queries, explore patterns, surface anomalies, and recommend actions, all grounded in context about your app and driven by real data.

## How it works

The Ask AI feature provides an intelligent analytics assistant that can:

- **Generate queries**: Ask questions in natural language and get SQL queries automatically generated
- **Explore patterns**: Discover trends and patterns in your data that might not be immediately obvious
- **Surface anomalies**: Identify unusual behavior or outliers in your metrics
- **Recommend actions**: Get actionable insights and recommendations based on your data

## Getting started

1. Navigate to any analytics dashboard in your Formo workspace
2. Look for the "Ask AI" button or chat interface
3. Type your question in natural language, such as:
   - "What are my top performing acquisition channels this month?"
   - "Show me users who dropped off in the signup funnel"
   - "Which wallets have the highest transaction volume?"
   - "Are there any unusual patterns in my recent activity?"

## Use cases

### Data exploration
Ask AI can help you explore your data without needing to know SQL or complex analytics queries. Simply describe what you want to understand, and the AI will generate the appropriate analysis.

### Pattern recognition
The AI can identify trends, seasonality, and patterns in your user behavior, transaction data, and conversion metrics that might be difficult to spot manually.

### Anomaly detection
Get alerts about unusual spikes, drops, or changes in your key metrics, along with potential explanations for what might be causing them.

### Actionable insights
Beyond just showing you data, Ask AI provides context and recommendations for what actions you might take based on the insights discovered.

## Best practices

- **Be specific**: The more specific your questions, the better the AI can help you
- **Provide context**: Mention time periods, user segments, or specific metrics you're interested in
- **Follow up**: Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into interesting findings
- **Validate insights**: Always review the AI's findings and validate important insights with your domain knowledge
