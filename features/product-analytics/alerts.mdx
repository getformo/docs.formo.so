Get notified on Email or Slack of high-value whales and important user actions:

- Key user events (connect wallet events, conversions, drop off)
- When whales and high-value users visit your app

In the project settings page, you can create an alert that will notify you via:

- Email
- Webhooks

### Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to send alerts to your own server or third-party service. You can set up a webhook URL in the project settings, and when an alert is triggered, a POST request will be sent to that URL with the alert data.

Here's an example of the JSON payload that will be sent to your webhook:

```json
{
  "alert_id": "XXXX_Test Alert 3_1753771336519_1753771433251",
  "alert_name": "Test Alert 3",
  "project_id": "XXXX",
  "project_name": "Example",
  "team_id": "XXXX",
  "event": {
    "properties": {
      "chain_id": 84532
    },
    "address": "0xF04bC8FdFC8b1c03Fa77885574Ae6Ea041E26bdc",
    "type": "connect",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "timezone": "Asia/Saigon",
    "location": "VN",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-29T06:42:16.519Z",
    "anonymous_id": "4b48c7b6-3d61-409f-b695-1d9452954d6b"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-29T06:43:53.268Z",

```
