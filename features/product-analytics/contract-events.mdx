Formo makes decoding contract activity on EVM blockchains as simple as possible. 
Add a contract address and ABI to start streaming contract events across chains.

<Frame caption="You can add one or more smart contracts to your project and specify events you care about.">

</Frame>

Once Formo ingests your contract events into our data platform, you will see events on the [Activity Feed](/product-analytics/activity) and [Wallet Profile](/wallet-intelligence/wallet-profiles) in real-time. 

See the list of supported chains [here](/chains/overview).
