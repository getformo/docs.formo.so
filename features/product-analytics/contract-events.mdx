Formo makes decoding contract activity on EVM blockchains as simple as possible. 
Simply specify a contract address and ABI to start streaming contract events across multiple different chains.

<Frame caption="You can add one or more smart contracts to your project and specify events you care about.">

Once added, Formo will start ingesting your contract events into our data platform. 
You will see these events on the [Activity Feed](/product-analytics/activity) and [Wallet Profile](/wallet-intelligence/wallet-profiles) pages. 
You can get notifications of important contract events with [Alerts](/features/product-analytics/alerts).
