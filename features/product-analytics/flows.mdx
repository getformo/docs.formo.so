User flow analysis (also known as [the Sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram)) identifies the most frequent paths taken by users to or from any event. Use Flows to understand how your users sequentially perform events in your product and analyze drop-offs or unsuccessful behavior.

You can learn the following from paths:
- What did users do immediately after signing up?
- Where are users are getting confused or stuck?
- Which parts of your app people are actually using?
- Why are users aren't discovering new features?
- Where are new users are landing into your website?
