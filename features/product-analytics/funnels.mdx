Funnels help you understand how users interact with your dapp.

- Analyze the user flow through your website and the different pages.
- Go beyond pageviews and use any custom events to build a funnel.
- Measure the conversion rate to understand the percentage of visitors who started the user flow and ended with a conversion event.
- Measure the percentage drop-off between the individual funnel steps to spot where you lose the most users.
- Use filters to segment your audience. Filter conversion funnels by marketing campaign, traffic source, device, and more.
