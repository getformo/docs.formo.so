Visualize how users progress through a series of steps with Funnel Analysis.

- Analyze the user flow across pages, domains, and subdomains throughout your site and app.
- Go beyond pageviews and track contract and custom events to build a funnel.
- Measure the conversion rate to understand the percentage of visitors who started the user flow and ended with a conversion event.
- Measure the percentage drop-off between the individual funnel steps to spot where you lose the most users.
- Use filters to segment your audience. Filter conversion funnels by marketing campaign, traffic source, device, and more.
