### Activity Feed

The real-time Activity Feed helps you **get actionable insights into onchain user behaviour.**. 

Formo automatically tracks page views, wallet connects, signatures, and transactions on your dapp. 
You can also track your own custom events with <a href="/install">the SDK</a>.

The Activity Feed empowers you to measure key events in the user lifecycle, identify drop-off points, and boost retention.
