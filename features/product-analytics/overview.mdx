## Cross-subdomain tracking

Formo automatically tracks visitors across all subdomains of your main domain, giving you a unified view of user journeys and attribution accuracy. This means you can follow users as they move between your marketing site, app, blog, and other subdomains—no extra setup required.

- **Unified visitor journey**: Track users as they navigate between your main site, app, and other subdomains
- **Accurate attribution**: Attribute conversions to the correct marketing channel, even if users move between subdomains
- **Simplified reporting**: View combined traffic, user behavior, and conversion data in a single dashboard

To enable cross-subdomain analytics, simply use your root domain when adding your project in the Formo dashboard. The Formo SDK handles all cookie and session management for you, ensuring seamless analytics across your entire product.
