The Formo SDK offers an easy-to-use event collection library that allows you to track custom events in your dapp.
Ensure high quality, structured data with Formo. 

```js
    formo.track(
		"product_added", {
			product_id: "123",
			product_name: "Formo T-shirt",
			price: 100,
			revenue: 10.5,
			points: 4.1
		}
	)
```

Custom events integrates with [Wallet intelligence](/features/wallet-intelligence) and [Funnels](/features/product-analytics/funnels) to give you a complete picture of each user's journey.

## Naming events

When naming events, Formo recommends establishing a consistent naming convention that uses:

- Consistent formatting: Event names are case sensitive.
- A consistent syntax: Song Played and Played Song are also considered separate events. For example, a standard of `[Noun] + [Past-Tense Verb]` ensures all your events are consistent.
- A consistent actor: Does 'Message Sent' mean that the user sent a message or that you sent a message to the user? If all your events are named in a way that reflects the user's perspective, the meaning is clear immediately.

## Revenue and points

Formo supports `revenue` and `points` tracking. [Learn more about tracking revenue](/data/events/track#properties).
