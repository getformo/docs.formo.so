The Formo SDK offers an easy-to-use event collection library that allows you to track custom events in your dapp.
Ensure high quality, structured data with Formo. 

Start tracking custom events with the [Web SDK](/sdks/web#custom-events) to get started.

```js
    formo.track(
		"product_added", {
			product_id: "123",
			product_name: "Formo T-shirt",
			price: 100,
			revenue: 10.5,
			points: 4.1
		}
	)
```

Custom events integrates with [Wallet intelligence](/features/wallet-intelligence) and [Funnels](/features/product-analytics/funnels) to give you a complete picture of each user's journey.

## Revenue and points

Formo supports tracking `revenue` and `points` in your events. Understand where your top revenue comes from. [Learn more about tracking revenue](/data/events/track#properties).
