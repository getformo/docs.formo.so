> This feature is in development and coming soon.

The Formo SDK is an easy-to-use event collection library that allows you to track custom events in your dapp.
Ensure high quality, structured data by 

```js
    formo.track(
		"product_added", {
			product_id: "123",
			product_name: "Formo T-shirt",
			price: 100,
			quantity: 2
		}
	)
```

When naming events, Formo recommends establishing a consistent naming convention that uses:

- Consistent formatting: Formo captures requires all events be lower case with underscores: `song_played`. Otherwise, 'Song Played' and 'song played' will be two separate events. This naming convention helps to prevent messy data, especially when multiple teams send the same event.
- A consistent syntax: Song Played and Played Song are also considered separate events. For example, a standard of `[Noun] + [Past-Tense Verb]` ensures all your events are consistent.
- A consistent actor: Does Message Sent mean that the user sent a message or that you sent a message to the user? If all your events are named in a way that reflects the user's perspective, the meaning is clear immediately.

Seamlessly integrate with Formo's [Wallet Intelligence](/features/wallet-intelligence) to get a holistic view of each customer from anonymous to known.
