## Overview

The Formo SDK offers an easy-to-use event collection library that allows you to track custom events in your dapp.
Ensure high quality, structured data with Formo. 

Start tracking custom events with the [Web SDK](/sdks/web#custom-events) to get started.

 ```tsx
	import { useFormo } from '@formo/analytics';

	const HomePage = () => {
	const analytics = useFormo();

	useEffect(() => {
		// Track a custom event
		analytics.track("Product Added", {
		product_id: "123",
		product_name: "Formo T-shirt",
		price: 100,
		revenue: 10.5,
		points: 4.1
	});
	}, [analytics]);

	return <div>Welcome to the Home Page!</div>;
	};

	export default HomePage;
```

Custom events integrates with [Wallet intelligence](/features/wallet-intelligence) and [Funnels](/features/product-analytics/funnels) to give you a complete picture of each user's journey.
