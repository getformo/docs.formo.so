The Formo SDK is an easy-to-use event collection library that allows you to track custom events in your dapp.
Ensure high quality, structured data by 

```js
    formo.track(
		"Added to cart", {
			product_id: "123",
			product_name: "Formo T-shirt",
			price: 100,
			quantity: 2
		}
	)
```

Seamlessly integrate with Formo's [Wallet Intelligence](/features/wallet-intelligence) to get a holistic view of each customer from anonymous to known.

Use [Funnels](/features/Product-analytics/funnels) to understand how users interact with your dapp.
