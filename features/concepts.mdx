Here are 3 core concepts you need to know:

1. **Events** are the things that happen in your app.
2. **Users** are the people who use your app.
3. **Properties** are the attributes of your users and events.

### Events

An event is **a data point that represents an interaction between a user and your product.** 

Events can be a wide range of interactions. For example, every time a user connects a wallet or performs an transaction on your app, there are details which describe that action the moment it happens. 

Actions like visiting a page, connecting a wallet, and depositing on a DeFi protocol can all be tracked as an event in Formo.

### Users

A user is **the specific individual who completed an interaction with your product.**

Each user has a unique identifier that you can use to track their activity. Formo uses wallet addresses as a user identifier for logged-in users and an autogenerated visitor ID for anonymous users.

### Properties

Properties are **additional information about users and events.**

A Connect Wallet event has wallet address and chain ID (Ethereum, Base, etc.) A Page View event has page URL, referrer URL, and other metadata.
