### Activity Metrics

The real-time Activity Feed helps you **understand your user journeys**. 
On the activity page, you can see live visitor counts, total page views, average session duration, bounce rate.

### Activity Feed

Formo automatically tracks page views, wallet connects, signatures, and transactions on your dapp. 
You can also track your own custom events with <a href="/install">the SDK</a>.

The Activity Feed empowers you to measure key events in the user lifecycle, identify drop-off points, and boost retention.
