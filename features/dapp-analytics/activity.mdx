On the activity page, you can see live visitor counts, total page views, average session duration, bounce rate.

Formo automatically tracks page views, wallet connects, signatures, and transactions on your dapp. 
You can also easily track your own custom events with <a href="/install">the SDK</a>.

Evaluate key events in the user lifecycle, identify drop-off points, and optmize conversion and retention.
