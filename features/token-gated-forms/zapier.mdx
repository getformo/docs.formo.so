## What is Zapier?

Zapier lets you [connect Formo to 2,000+ other web services](https://zapier.com/apps/formo/integrations). Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the Trigger, where your information comes from and which causes one or more Actions in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

Sign up for a free Zapier account, from there you can jump right in. To help you hit the ground running, here are some Zap ideas:

## Setting Up Slack Integration in Zapier

### Prerequisites

- A Zapier account
- Your Formo Workspace API Key

### Get your API Key

To find your API Key, go to your workspace settings page with the 'Settings' link on the left sidebar:

<Frame caption="Find your API Key in your workspace settings page.">
    <img src="/images/zapier-0.png" alt="Token Gated Forms Zapier" />
</Frame>

- Click the copy button in the 'Workspace API Key' to copy it.
- You will need this in Step 2.

### Step 1: Initial Zapier Setup

1. Log into your Zapier account.
2. Click "Create Zap" in the top navigation.

### Step 2: Configure Formo Trigger

1. In the trigger section, search for and select "Formo."
2. Choose "New Form Event" as your trigger event.
3. Connect your Formo account:
   - Go to your Formo team settings page.
   - Paste your Formo API key in Zapier to authenticate.

### Step 3: Configure Form Settings

1. Locate your Form ID:
   - Navigate to your form's edit page in Formo.
   - Copy the Form ID from your current URL (e.g., the form ID of `https://app.formo.so/20uTXhGkUKCYkssRDKLtm/edit` is `20uTXhGkUKCYkssRDKLtm`)
2. In Zapier, paste in your Form ID.
3. Select your desired event type:
   - "New Form Response" - triggers when someone submits a response to your form.
   - "Form Updates" - triggers when form data is modified.

### Step 4: Configure Slack Action (Slack Example)

1. Click the plus (+) icon to add an action.
2. Search for and select "Slack" as your action app.
3. Choose your desired Slack action:
   - "Send Channel Message" (recommended for team notifications.)
   - "Send Direct Message" (for individual notifications.)
4. Connect your Slack account if not already connected.

### Step 5: Customize Slack Message

1. Select the Slack channel or user to receive notifications.
2. Design your message format using Formo form fields.
3. Include relevant information such as:
   - Submission timestamp
   - Form name
   - Response data
   - Any custom fields

### Step 6: Test and Enable

1. Click "Test & Review" to verify your setup.
2. Check your Slack channel to confirm the test message.
3. If everything looks correct, click "Publish" to enable your Zap.

### Troubleshooting

- If triggers aren't working, verify your API key is correct.
- Ensure your Form ID matches exactly.
- Check that your Slack permissions are properly configured.
