## What is Zapier?

Zapier lets you [connect Formo to 2,000+ other web services](https://zapier.com/apps/formo/integrations). Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the Trigger, where your information comes from and which causes one or more Actions in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

Sign up for a free Zapier account, from there you can jump right in. To help you hit the ground running, here are some Zap ideas: 
- Get a [Slack notification](#setting-up-slack-notifications-in-zapier) on a new form submission
- Get an [email notification](#setting-up-email-notifications-in-zapier) on a new form submission

## Prerequisites

- A Zapier account
- Your Formo Workspace API Key

### Get your Workspace API Key

Go to your workspace settings page with the 'Settings' link on the top left workspace dropdown and find:

</Frame>

- Click the copy button in the 'Workspace API Key' to copy it.
- You will need this in the next step.
