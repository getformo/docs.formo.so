Each user is assigned a **wallet score.** This score is calculated from their onchain footprint, <a href="/features/wallet-intelligence/wallet-labels">wallet labels</a>, attestations, and proof-of-personhood.

Use this score to segment and rank your users. Distinguish genuine users from bots and sybil farmers.
