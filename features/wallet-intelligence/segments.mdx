title: 'User segments'
description: 'Create and manage user segments in Formo, grouping users based on demographics, behaviors, and wallet properties.'

Segments are groups of users that share a certain set of properties or who perform a similar sequence of events. 
Formo lets you define segments, view the list of users that comprise them, compare them in your analysis, and share them with your team.

<Frame caption="A segment is a group of users who share a property or set of properties.">

</Frame>

Target exactly the right people based on any number or combination of conditions:
- US Users: Users who are from the US
- DeFi Users: Users with the 'DeFi Trader' or 'Dex User' <a href="/features/wallet-intelligence/wallet-labels">Wallet label</a>
- Whales: Users with the 'Whale' label who have net worth above $1M.
- Dropped-Off Users: Users who did not come back the following week

You can use both offchain and onchain properties to create your segments.
