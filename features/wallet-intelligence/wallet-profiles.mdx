Formo's **Wallet Intelligence** collects and uses data from offchain and onchain data sources to give you a unified view of your users.
Turn anonymous wallets into high-value users and track usage of specific, high-value wallets on your dapp.

Gain a complete view of each user's behaviour across chains and platforms:
- Wallet address, ENS profile, net worth, and transaction frequency
- Real-time feed of what each user is doing on your dapp, with full attribution through referrers and UTM sources
- Dapps the user has interacted with
- DeFi positions and token balances of the user across multiple chains

> In the future, you will see:
> - Wallet labels based on the user's onchain activity (DeFi Trader, NFT Collector, etc.)
> - NFTs held by the user
> - Linked multiple wallets
> - CAC/ARPU/LTV
