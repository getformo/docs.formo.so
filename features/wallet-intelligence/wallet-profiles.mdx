Formo's **Wallet Profiles** unifies data from offchain and onchain data sources to give you a 360Â° view of your users.
Turn anonymous wallets into high-value users. Track session duration, page views, and user journeys to understand how people actually use your app.

Gain a complete view of each user's behaviour across chains and platforms:
- Wallet address, ENS profile, net worth, and transaction frequency
- Real-time feed of what each user is doing on your dapp, with full attribution through referrers and UTM sources
- Dapps the user has interacted with
- DeFi positions and token balances of the user across multiple chains

Wallet profiles will also display:
- Wallet labels based on the user's onchain activity (DeFi Trader, NFT Collector, etc.)
- NFTs held by the user
- Linked wallet addresses
- CAC/ARPU/LTV
