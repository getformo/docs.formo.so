The Wallet Profile page shows you **detailed information about a user**. Here you can turn anonymous wallets into high-value users and track usage of specific, high-value wallets on your dapp.

Uncover detailed information about each user:
- Wallet address, ENS profile, net worth, and transaction velocity
- Real-time feed of what each user is doing on your dapp, with full attribution through referrers and UTM sources
- Dapps this user has interacted with
- DeFi positions and token balances across multiple chains

You can also see each user's **Wallet Reputation Score.** This score is calculated from each users's onchain footprint, wallet labels, attestations, and proof-of-personhood to segment and rank your users.

Formo's **Wallet Intelligence** collects and uses data from offchain and onchain data sources to give you a unified view of your users.
