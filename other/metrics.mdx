Here is a list of what we do and don’t collect from your visitors.

### Cookies

> We do NOT set any cookies.

We care about the privacy of your visitors. Cookies are something that can track visitors across multiple pages or even multiple websites. 
Formo does not set any cookies. 

### User Agents

> We collect and store user agents.

User agents are the identifiers of the browser and device of the visitor. Browsers or devices identify themselves to websites. 
We collect and store the user agent to identify the browser and device of the visitor.

### Country

> We collect and store country of each visitor.

We collect visitor country based on the their time zone, not their IP address. Every country has their own time zone and modern devices automatically update the time zone when the device travels. 
The time zone is limited to a country, so we can’t get data about a city or region within a country.

### Language

> We collect and store language of each visitor.

Devices are set to a certain language. We collect the language of the device being used by a visitor.

### URLs

> We collect and store URLs.

We collect the URL to track page visits and referrers.

### Referrers

> We collect and store referrers.

Referrers answer the question “Where did this visitor come from?”. Browsers send the URL of the previous website as a referrer. 
We also check UTM-parameters. You can see a list of your site's referrers in your dashboard.

### UTM parameters

> We collect and store UTM parameters.

UTM parameters such as `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, and `utm_campaign`, are a way to track the source of a visitor. 
They are added to a URL to track where a visitor came from.

We track these UTM codes:

- `utm_source` (e.g.: google.com)
- `utm_medium` (e.g.: search)
- `utm_campaign` (e.g.: summer_sale)

### Wallet Type

> We collect and store the crypto wallet type of visitors.

We collect the wallet type (EIP6963's `rdns` identifier) to identify a visitor.

### Wallet Address

### Chain Id

We collect the chain id to identify the connected chain of the visitor.

### Wallet Connected

> We collect and store wallet connected status.

We collect the wallet connected status to identify if a visitor has connected their wallet.

### Signature and Transaction Metadata
