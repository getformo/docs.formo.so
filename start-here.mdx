## What is Formo?

[Formo](https://formo.so) is a web3 data platform that helps you understand your users and how they engage with your app so you can build a better product. 

> [Learn why we're building Formo](https://formo.so/about).

Here's a quick overview of what Formo can do:

## Product Analytics

**Product analytics** is actionable analytics designed for onchain apps: 

- 📊 **Track web3 growth metrics.** Track visitor counts, DAU, WAU, MAU, transactions, retention, and churn. Measure engagement and growth over time.
- 🎯 **Onchain Attribution.** Identify the top channels and growth initiatives that drive onchain activity. Understand where users come from. 
- 🔒 **Privacy-friendly.** No cookies, no personal data. Just clear, privacy-friendly insights limited to a single device, a single website, and a single day. Formo helps your dapp align with GDPR standards.

## Wallet Intelligence

**Wallet intelligence** helps you understand and activate your high-value users:

-  🕵️‍♂️ **Wallet profiles.** Turn anonymous wallets into high-value users with unified onchain and offchain data. Track usage of specific, high-value wallets on your dapp. 
-  💯 **Wallet labels and reputation score.** Use wallet labels, onchain attestations, and proof-of-personhood to segment and rank your users.
-  💬 **Wallet messaging.** Activate high-value target users with deep personalization and insights.

## Token Gated Forms

**Token Gated Forms** helps you launch waitlists, forms, and surveys in web3:

-  🔐 **Token gating.** Capture wallet data, token balances, attestations, and other onchain signals.
-  ✅ **Verified socials.** Verify Twitter accounts, Discord usernames, Farcaster, and more.
-  🎨 **Extensive template library.** Choose from a variety of form templates or build your own.

Focus on building amazing products and experiences. Spend less time building analytics, and more time building products with Formo.
