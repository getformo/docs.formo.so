## What is Formo?

**Formo** is a product analytics platform that helps you understand your users and how they engage with your app so you can build a better product in web3. 

With **dapp analytics**, you can: 

- **Track web3 growth metrics.** Track visitor counts, DAU, WAU, MAU, transactions, retention, and churn. Measure user activity over time.
- **Understand how users engage with your dapp.** Evaluate key events in the user lifecycle. Follow your users to uncover drop-off points and retention drivers.
- **Onchain Attribution.** Identify the top channels and growth initiatives that drive onchain activity. Understand where users come from. 

**Wallet intelligence** lets you engage your high-intent users:

-   **Wallet profiles.** Turn anonymous wallets into high-value users with unified onchain and offchain data. Track usage of specific, high-value wallets on your dapp. 
-   **Wallet reputation scoring.** Use wallet labels, onchain attestations, and proof-of-personhood to segment and rank your users.
-   **Wallet holdings and activity.** View your users' token holdings and top apps. Find out who is using your competitors.



Formo empowers you to spend less time building analytics, and more time building products. Understand and use onchain data to turbocharge your growth. 

## Concepts

Before setting up Formo, you should know the 3 key concepts that make up Formo:

- **Events** are the things that happen in your dapp.
- **Users** are the people who use your dapp.
- **Properties** are the attributes of your users and events.

### Events

**An event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and your product.** Events can be a wide range of interactions. 

For example, every time a user connects a wallet or performs an onchain transaction on your dapp, there are details which describe that action the moment it happens. 
Actions like visiting a page or swapping on a DEX can be tracked as an event in Formo.

### Users

**A user is the specific individual who completed an interaction with your product.**

Each user has a unique identifier that you can use to track their activity. Formo uses the wallet address to identify users.

### Properties

**Additional information about users and events are called properties.**

For a Connect Wallet event, its properties are wallet address, wallet type (Metamask, Rainbow) and chain (Ethereum, Base, etc.)
