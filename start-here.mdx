## What is Formo?

[Formo](https://formo.so) is a web3 data platform that helps you understand your users and how they engage with your app so you can build a better product. Spend less time building analytics, and more time building products.

**Give your team data superpowers.** Here's a quick overview of what Formo can do:

### Dapp Analytics

**Dapp analytics** is web3-native product analytics: 

- 📊 **Track web3 growth metrics.** Track visitor counts, DAU, WAU, MAU, transactions, retention, and churn. Measure engagement and growth over time.
- 🏃‍♀️‍➡️ **Real-time activity feed.** See what users are doing in real-time. Uncover hidden drop-off points and retention drivers. 
- 🎯 **Onchain Attribution.** Identify the top channels and growth initiatives that drive onchain activity. Understand where users come from. 
- 🔒 **Privacy-friendly.** No cookies, no personal data. Just clear, privacy-friendly insights limited to a single device, a single website, and a single day. Formo helps your dapp align with GDPR standards.
- ⚡️ **Lightweight script.** Our tracking script stays under 1kb, ensuring your site remains fast and efficient.

### Wallet Intelligence

**Wallet intelligence** activate your high-intent users and whales:

-  🕵️‍♂️ **Wallet profiles.** Turn anonymous wallets into high-value users with unified onchain and offchain data. Track usage of specific, high-value wallets on your dapp. 
-  💯 **Wallet reputation score.** Use wallet labels, onchain attestations, and proof-of-personhood to segment and rank your users.
-  🤹 **Wallet holdings and activity.** View your users' token holdings and top apps. Find out who is using similar apps.

### Token Gated Forms

**Token Gated Forms** helps you launch waitlists, signup forms, and surveys for web3:

## Key Concepts

Before setting up Formo, you should know 3 key concepts that make up Formo:

1. **Events** are the things that happen in your dapp.
2. **Users** are the people who use your dapp.
3. **Properties** are the attributes of your users and events.

### 1. Events

**An event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and your product.** Events can be a wide range of interactions. 

For example, every time a user connects a wallet or performs an onchain transaction on your dapp, there are details which describe that action the moment it happens. 
Actions like visiting a page or swapping on a DEX can be tracked as an event in Formo.

### 2. Users

**A user is the specific individual who completed an interaction with your product.**

Each user has a unique identifier that you can use to track their activity. Formo uses the wallet address to identify users.

### 3. Properties

**Additional information about users and events are called properties.**

For a Connect Wallet event, its properties are wallet address, wallet type (Metamask, Rainbow) and chain (Ethereum, Base, etc.)
