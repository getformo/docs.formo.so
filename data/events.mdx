The Formo Event Spec outlines how to send event data to Formo's APIs and the proper format to capture events using Formo's SDKs.

## Events API

The Formo API spec supports the following calls, each gathering important data about the user:

| API call | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Identify | Identifies a visitor or user |
| Page | Records when a user visits a new page in your application |
| Track | Records custom events with arbitrary data |
| Reset | Resets all stored information about the previously identified user |
| Connect | Records when a user connects their wallet to your application |
| Disconnect | Records when a user disconnects their wallet |
| Chain | Records when a user switches to a different blockchain network |
| Signature | Records signature requests and their statuses |
| Transaction | Records blockchain transactions and their statuses |

## Event data format

The event data is collected as JSON and includes common properties along with API-specific properties in the `payload`.

```
`id` String `json:$.id`
`project_id` String `json:$.project_id`,
`session_id` String `json:$.session_id`,
`anonymous_id` String `json:$.anonymous_id`,
`user_id` Nullable(String) `json:$.user_id`,
`address` Nullable(String) `json:$.address`,
`action` LowCardinality(String) `json:$.action`,
`version` LowCardinality(String) `json:$.version`,
`payload` String `json:$.payload`,
`timestamp` DateTime `json:$.timestamp`,
```
