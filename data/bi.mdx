Formo is compatible with BI tools through our HTTP interface, enabling you to connect popular BI tools, SQL clients, and data visualization platforms directly to Formo.

This interface provides a standardized way to query your data using SQL, making it easy to integrate Formo with your existing analytics workflow and third-party tools.

## Configuration

To connect to Formo, use these standard connection parameters:

### Connection settings

- **Protocol**: HTTPS
- **Host**: `clickhouse.eu-central-1.aws.tinybird.co`
- **Port**: `443`
- **SSL/TLS**: Required (enabled)

### Authentication settings

- **Database name**: `formo`
- **Username**: `formo`
- **Password**: `<Your BI Read Key>` (Your Formo BI Read Token)

Find your **BI Read key** in the project settings page under 'Credentials'.

</Frame>

BI read keys expire in one week, but you can get a fresh key on the project settings page.

## Compatible tools

Formo works with various BI tools and SQL clients:
- Grafana
- Hex 
- Metabase
- Superset
- Power BI
- Tableau


Any tool that supports ClickHouseÂ® HTTP interface can potentially work with Formo.

## Limitations

The BI interface to Formo is read-only. You can use it to query, visualize, and analyze data from your Formo Data Sources, but you cannot modify data through this connection.

You cannot perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or any DDL operations (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication failures**

Error: Authentication failed

- Check your BI Read Token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the token has read permissions for the workspace
- Verify the token is entered in the password field

**SSL/TLS errors**

Error: SSL connection error

- Ensure SSL/TLS is enabled in your client
- Use port 443 with HTTPS protocol
- Check that your client supports TLS 1.2 or higher

**Query timeouts**

Error: Query timeout

- Add appropriate WHERE clauses to filter data
- Use LIMIT to reduce result set size
- Consider querying materialized views instead of raw data
