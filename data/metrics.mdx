### Visitors

A visitor is only counted once within a 24 hour window. The 24 hour limit is necessary to comply with GDPR.

### Current Visitors

### Page Views

### Sessions

A session (also known as a visit) is a set of actions that a user takes on your site. 
Each session is a 24 hour window. If a visitor returns after this window, a new session is counted.

This is useful for debugging and identifying problems on your site. 
For example, if visitors are not completing transactions, you can see which pages were visited and what events were triggered to identify a common problem on your site that is preventing visitors from completing.

The bounce rate is the relative number of visitors who have left the site after a single page view, compared to the total number of unique visitors.

How many users come to your site or dapp from a particular source. We track these UTM codes:

- `utm_source` (e.g.: google.com)
