Set up a Reverse ETL pipeline to export events and the results of a query to a downstream destination.
Data exports can be executed on a defined schedule or on-demand.

Common uses cases include:

- Push events to Kafka as part of an event-driven architecture.
- Hydrating a data lake or data warehouse on AWS S3 with real-time data.
- Exporting data to other systems that consume data.
