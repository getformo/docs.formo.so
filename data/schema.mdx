Formoâ€™s extensive data catalog provides detailed insights on events, users, andwallet profiles across chains.

- **Events** and **Users** are first-party data. Access is restricted to members of each workspace. 
- **Wallet profiles** do not include project-specific data and is globally accessible.

You can query raw data with the [SQL Query API](/api-reference/overview#sql-query-api) and export queries to your own data warehouse with [Reverse ETL](/data/reverse-etl).
