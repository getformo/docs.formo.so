Formoâ€™s extensive data catalog provides detailed insights on events, users, and profiles across chains.

Events and users are project-specific and restricted to users with workspace access. 

Wallet profile data omits project-specific details and is globally accessible.

You can query data directly with the [SQL Query API](/api-reference/overview#sql-query-api).
