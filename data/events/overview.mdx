The Formo Event Spec outlines how to send event data to Formo's APIs and the proper format to capture events using Formo's SDKs and APIs.

## Events API

The Events API supports the following calls, each gathering important data about the user:

| API call | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Identify](/data/events/identify) | Identifies a visitor or user |
| [Track](/data/events/track) | Records a custom action with arbitrary data |
| [Page](/data/events/page) | Records a page view on your app |
| [Connect](/data/events/connect) | Records when a user connects their wallet to your application |
| [Disconnect](/data/events/disconnect) | Records when a user disconnects their wallet |
| [Chain](/data/events/chain) | Records when a user switches to a different blockchain network |
| [Signature](/data/events/signature) | Records signature requests and their statuses |
| [Transaction](/data/events/transaction) | Records blockchain transactions and their statuses |

## Event Properties

Event data is collected as JSON and includes common properties along with API-specific properties in the `payload`.

```
`id` String
`project_id` String
`session_id` String
`anonymous_id` String
`user_id` Nullable(String)
`address` Nullable(String)
`action` LowCardinality(String)
`version` LowCardinality(String)
`payload` String
`timestamp` DateTime
```
