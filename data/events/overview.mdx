The Formo Event Spec outlines how to send event data to Formo's APIs and the proper format to capture events using Formo's SDKs and APIs.

## Events API

The Events API supports the following calls, each gathering important data about the user:

| API call | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| [Identify](/data/events/identify) | Identifies a visitor or user |
| [Detect](/data/events/detect) | Identifies a user's wallet provider |
| [Track](/data/events/track) | Records a custom action with arbitrary data |
| [Page](/data/events/page) | Records a page view on your app |
| [Connect](/data/events/connect) | Records when a user connects their wallet to your application |
| [Disconnect](/data/events/disconnect) | Records when a user disconnects their wallet |
| [Chain](/data/events/chain) | Records when a user switches to a different blockchain network |
