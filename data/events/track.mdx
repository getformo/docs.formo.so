title: 'Spec: Track'
---

The Track API call is how you record any [custom events](/features/product-analaytics/custom-events) your users perform, 
along with any properties that describe the action.

## Event Names

Use a descriptive human readable name. Adopt nouns and past tense verbs like **Swap Reviewed** and **Order Submitted**.
This allows everyone (including you 6 months from now) to instantly understand the meaning of an event.

## Fields

Apart from the [common fields](/data/events/common), the `track` call accepts the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `event` | String | âœ“ | Name of the user action |
| `properties` | Object |  | Includes the properties associated with the event. For more information, check the Properties section below. |


## Properties

Properties are additional information that give more clarity of your users' actions.

Formo has reserved some standard properties listed in the following table and handles them in a special manner.

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| `revenue` | Number | The revenue amount as a result of an event. For e.g., a transaction worth $20.00 would result in a revenue of 20.00. |
| `currency` | String | The currency of the revenue as a result of the event, set in ISO 4127 format. If this is not set, Formo assumes the revenue is in USD. |
| `value` | String | An abstract value such as points or XP associated with an event, to be used by various teams. |
