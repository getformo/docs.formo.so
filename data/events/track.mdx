title: 'Spec: Track'
---

The Track API call is how you record any [custom actions](/features/product-analytics/custom-events) your users are doing, 
along with any properties that describe the action.

Track events can capture a broad range of actions, such as clicking a button or completing a purchase.

Additional information about the event can be included in the properties field. For example, for a Purchase Complete event, you may want to include the product ids of the purchased products.

## Naming events

When naming events, Formo recommends establishing a consistent naming convention that uses:

- Consistent formatting: Event names are case sensitive.
- A consistent syntax:  Adopt nouns and past tense verbs like **Swap Reviewed** and **Order Submitted**. A standard of `[Noun] + [Past-Tense Verb]` ensures all your events are consistent.
- A consistent actor: Does 'Message Sent' mean that the user sent a message or that you sent a message to the user? If all your events are named in a way that reflects the user's perspective, the meaning is clear immediately.

This allows everyone including you 6 months from now to instantly understand the meaning of an event.

## Fields

Apart from the [common fields](/data/events/common), the `track` call accepts the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `event` | String | âœ“ | Name of the user action |
| `properties` | Object |  | Includes the properties associated with the event. For more information, check the Properties section below. |


## Properties

Properties are additional information that give more clarity of your users' actions.

Formo has reserved some standard properties listed in the following table and handles them in a special manner.

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|
| `revenue` | Number | The revenue amount as a result of an event. For e.g., a transaction worth $20.00 would result in a revenue of 20.00. |
| `currency` | String | The currency of the revenue as a result of the event, set in ISO 4127 format. If this is not set, Formo assumes the revenue is in USD. |
| `points` | String | An abstract value such as points or XP associated with an event, to be used by various teams. |

The above properties are used in the dashboards for calculate total revenue and points.
