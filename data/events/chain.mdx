title: 'Spec: Chain'
---

The `chain` event is emitted whenever the user's chain network changes.
It includes the chain ID the user switched to.

Here’s the payload of a typical call with most common fields removed:

```json
{
    "type": "chain", 
    "properties": {
        "chain_id": 1,
        "address": "0x8e6ca77a7e044ba836a97beb796c124ca3a6a154"
    }
}
```
