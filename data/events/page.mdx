The `page_hit` event records whenever a user views a page of your website.

Hereâ€™s the payload of a typical call with most common fields removed:


```json
{
    "action": "page_hit",   
    "payload": {
        "pathname": "/faucets",
        "href": "https://formo.so/faucets?utm_source=chatgpt.com",
        "hash": "#submit"
    }
}
```
