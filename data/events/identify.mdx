title: 'Spec: Identify'
---

The `identify` event lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. 
It includes a unique User ID, wallet name, and wallet rdns.

Hereâ€™s the payload of a typical call with most common fields removed:

```json
{
    "action": "identify",   
    "payload": {
        "address": "0x9798d87366bdfc5d70b300abdffc4f9e95369b3d",
        "provider_name": "MetaMask",
        "rdns": "io.metamask"
    }
}
```
