All API endpoints require authentication using either: 
- a **SDK Write Key** to send events
- a **Query API Read Token** to query events
- a **Workspace API Key** to manage forms

You'll need to include the key or token in the request headers for all API calls.

## Tokens

Send events with the SDK Write Key in your project settings.

Query events with the Query API Read Token in your project settings.

### Request Headers

Include the Token in your request headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Workspace API Key

Find your API key in your workspace settings. This key is unique to your workspace and should be kept secure.

```

Call this endpoint with the workspace API key to view your workspace details.

```
