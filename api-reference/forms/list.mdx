## Field Value Transformations

The API automatically transforms certain field values based on their type:

-   Select/Radio fields: Values are transformed to their display labels
-   Checkbox groups: Values are transformed into an array of `{label, value}` objects
-   Identity fields: Address objects are flattened to strings

## Notes

-   The endpoint returns the 10 most recent form submissions
-   Field names in the response are derived from form field labels, converted to snake_case
-   All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format
