### Overview

As [described on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP): Content Security Policy (CSP) is a feature that helps to prevent or minimize the risk of certain types of security threats. It consists of a series of instructions from a website to a browser, which instruct the browser to place restrictions on the things that the code comprising the site is allowed to do.

The primary use case for CSP is to control which resources, in particular JavaScript resources, a document is allowed to load. This is mainly used as a defense against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, in which an attacker is able to inject malicious code into the victim's site.

If you choose to use a CSP it is important to ensure that Formo domains are permitted.

### How to Enable CSP

Below is an example of a relatively restrictive CSP that limits only scripts and API calls to all Formo domains.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self' https://*.formo.so; 
  connect-src 'self' https://*.formo.so;
">
```

Add the script above within the `<head>` tag of your site to enable CSP.

### Domains used by Formo

| Domain | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| `events.formo.so` | Ingestion endpoint for SDK API calls |
| `cdn.formo.so` | CDN for SDK assets |
